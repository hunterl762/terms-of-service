      Agreement is legally binding between you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and Hunters Development (doing business as
      “HD”,
      “we”, “us” or “our”). If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you
      represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to this Agreement, in which case the terms “User”, “you”
      or “your” shall refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of
      this Agreement, you must not accept this Agreement and may not access and use the Services. By accessing and using
      the Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this
      Agreement.
      You acknowledge that this Agreement is a contract between you and HD, even though it is electronic and is not
      physically signed by you, and it governs your use of the Services.</p>
